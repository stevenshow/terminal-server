# terminal-server
Currently hosting/serving the data for my terminal style portfolio website

## Getting Started:
- Clone git repo
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm start` - This will run the server with `nodemon` so that chagnes are updated in real time
- Direct traffic to port `3000`

## Endpoints:
### Cards
- There are three endpoints here that server the data for the site
  - `/` Will give the Home page cards
  - `/projects` Will give the Project cards
  - `/contact` Will give the contact cards
